# AI-empowered-predictive-technologies-to-assess-IUU-Fishing-Risk-Across-Global-Seascapes

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to assess the risk of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing activities across global seascapes. By analyzing large-scale marine data, we aim to provide predictive insights into fishing practices that threaten the sustainability of marine ecosystems. The goal is to improve fisheries management, ensure compliance with regulations, and reduce the environmental impact of illegal fishing.

## Key Features

- **AI-based Risk Assessment**: Use AI models to predict IUU fishing risk based on various maritime data points.
- **Global Coverage**: Analyze data from global maritime regions to assess the scale and scope of IUU fishing activities.
- **Data Integration**: Combine satellite imagery, historical fishing data, weather patterns, and vessel movement data for accurate risk analysis.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Provide forecasts of potential IUU hotspots, helping authorities focus on high-risk areas.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple tools to view predictions, track trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Artificial Intelligence**: To build predictive models that assess IUU fishing risks.
- **Satellite Imagery**: Data from sources like Maxar and GFW (Global Fishing Watch).
- **Python**: Core programming language used for development.
- **Machine Learning**: Models trained on historical maritime data to predict future IUU fishing activity.
- **Data APIs**: Access maritime data through APIs such as GFW, Skylight, and others.
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive interface for visualizing fishing risk data and trends.
